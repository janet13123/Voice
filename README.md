Simple versions of tools to analyze a voice - display FFT and Formants.

All of these require python to be installed:

GetFormants.py - takes a snapshot of the voice and saves it into a file and 
                 also displays the FFT and Formants

GetFormantsGUI.py - Same as GetFormants with a GUI to allow selection of past 
                    files to be viewed.

VoiceView.py - displays the Pitch, FFT, and Formants in real time.

VoiceViewGUI.py - same as above but with a GUI to allow selection of the 
                  frequency range.
